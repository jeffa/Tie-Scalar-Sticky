=head1 NAME

Tie::Scalar::Sticky - Block assignments to scalars

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use strict;
 use Tie::Scalar::Sticky;

 tie my $sticky, 'Tie::Scalar::Sticky';

 $sticky = 42;
 $sticky = '';       # still 42
 $sticky = undef;    # still 42
 $sticky = 0;        # now it's zero

 tie my $sticky, 'Tie::Scalar::Sticky' => qw/ foo bar /;

 $sticky = 42;
 $sticky = 'foo';    # still 42
 $sticky = 'bar';    # still 42
 $sticky = 0;        # now it's zero

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Scalars tie'ed to this module will 'reject' any assignments
of undef or the empty string or any of the extra arugments
provided to C<tie()>. It simply removes the need for
you to validate assignments, such as:

 $var = $val unless grep $val eq $_, qw(not one of these);

Actually, that is the exact idea used in this module ...

So, why do this? Because i recently had to loop through a
list where some items were undefined and the previously
defined value should be used instead. In a nutshell:

 tie my $sticky, 'Tie::Scalar::Sticky' => 9, 'string';
 for (3,undef,'string',2,'',1,9,0) {
    $sticky = $_;
    print $sticky, ' ';
 }

should print: 3 3 2 2 1 0

=head1 CREDITS 

Dan Brook added support for user-defined strings by changing
C<$self> to a glob. His patch was applied to Version 1.02
verbatim, i later 'simplified' the code by assuming that
undef and the empty strings (the only two items Version
1.00 will block) are already waiting inside C<@$$self>.
Dan then removed undef from C<@$$self>, and i added a simple
check that returns from STORE unless $val is defined.
